# â€‹ Order Engine - Event-Driven Order Processing System

A simplified **event-driven order processing backend**, built with **Java 21** and **Spring Boot**, simulating the core of an e-commerce platform.  
You can send order-related events (create, pay, ship, cancel) via REST, track order states, and monitor status changes through observer logging and alerts.
